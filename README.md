# Digital-Twin-Challenges
 1. The Wealth Accumulator (Compounding Growth)
The Scenario: You have a savings account. Every month, you earn interest based on the current balance, and you also deposit a fixed portion of your salary.
Stock: Bank Balance.
Inflows: Interest Earned, Monthly Deposit.
Challenge: Observe how "Interest Earned" creates a Reinforcing Loop that leads to exponential growth.

2. The Leaky Water Tank (Simple Equilibrium)
The Scenario: A water tank is being filled by a constant inflow. However, the pressure at the bottom causes water to leak out; the more water in the tank, the faster the leak.
Stock: Water Volume.
Inflow: Constant Tap Flow.
Outflow: Leakage Rate (proportional to Water Volume).
Challenge: Find the "Steady State" where the inflow equals the outflow.
