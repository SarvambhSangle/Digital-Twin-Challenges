# Digital-Twin-Challenges
 1. The Wealth Accumulator (Compounding Growth)
The Scenario: You have a savings account. Every month, you earn interest based on the current balance, and you also deposit a fixed portion of your salary.
Stock: Bank Balance.
Inflows: Interest Earned, Monthly Deposit.
Challenge: Observe how "Interest Earned" creates a Reinforcing Loop that leads to exponential growth.

2. The Leaky Water Tank (Simple Equilibrium)
The Scenario: A water tank is being filled by a constant inflow. However, the pressure at the bottom causes water to leak out; the more water in the tank, the faster the leak.
Stock: Water Volume.
Inflow: Constant Tap Flow.
Outflow: Leakage Rate (proportional to Water Volume).
Challenge: Find the "Steady State" where the inflow equals the outflow.

3. Population Dynamics (The Birth-Death Loop)
The Scenario: A city population grows based on a birth rate (percentage of the population) and declines based on a death rate.
Stock: Population.
Inflow: Births.
Outflow: Deaths.
Challenge: Model what happens when the birth rate is slightly higher than the death rate versus when it is lower.

4. Academic Research & Publication Cycle: Model the flow of "Research Ideas" into "Manuscripts" and finally into "Published Papers," including the significant time delays of the "Peer Review" process and its impact on a researcher's "Knowledge" stock.

5.  Tourism Overload (Over tourism): Model how the reinforcing loop of "City Popularity" leads to a stock of "Tourists" that eventually triggers a balancing loop of "Infrastructure Strain" and "Environmental Decay," lowering the city's future appeal.
